Automatic scalable video documentation from source code proof of concept.

See: [Handbook Material Enhancements](https://github.com/DragonAgility/Program-Agility/issues/187)

Should be able to go from:

All via markdown files living within source control.

This is GitOps for documentation, education, and evaluation.
